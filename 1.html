    Tell me what you <strong><u>really like</u></strong><br>
    Baby, I can take my time<br>
    We don't ever have to fight<br>
    Just take it step-by-step<br>
    I can see it in your eyes<br>
    'Cause they never tell me lies<br>
    I can feel that body shake<br>
    And the heat between your legs<br>
    You've been scared of love and what it did to you<br>
    You don't have to run, I know what you've been through<br>
    Just a simple touch and it can set you free<br>
    We don't have to rush when you're alone with me<br>
  </p>

    <strong>
      I feel it <u>coming</u>, I feel it coming, babe<br>
      I feel it <u>coming</u>, I feel it coming, babe<br>
      I feel it <u>coming</u>, I feel it coming, babe<br>
      I feel it <u>coming</u>, I feel it coming, babe
